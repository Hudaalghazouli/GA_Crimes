## Purpose
Georgia has been in the news a lot in the last few years especially due to the recent up surge of crimes. As some of us are residents of Georgia, we are aware that most of these crimes are confined to certain counties of Georgia but to truly understand the true nature of these crimes, we decided to dig deeper into the Georgia county data available from our data sources by looking at the average income of each of the counties and see its correlation with crime.

With ORI (Originating Agency Identifier) of the Georgia law enforcement system, we will be able to extract different crime data from 2017 to 2020 inside Georgia. By utilizing different data sources, Jupyter notebook, Leaflet, Plotly, Postgres SQL, HTML/CSS, JS, and LoDash (the unintroduced JS library), we analyze the GA county crimes and the median household income to show:

* Index page with the summary of crime data and household income data
* Dashboard with bar charts for each year (2017-2020)
* Leaflet page with the map that has median household income data and crime data with filtered checkboxes

## Data Sources
* "Crime Data" API Call on <a href = "https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend">Crime Data</a>
* "Median Household Income" Dataset <a href = "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=175&eid=266512">Median Household Income Data</a>
